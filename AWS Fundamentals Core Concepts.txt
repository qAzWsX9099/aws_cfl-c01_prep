* [AWS Well-Architectured Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?e=gs2020&p=fundcore&p=gsrc&c=fcc&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc)

* Architectural Tradeoffs: Business Needs vs Best Practices

### 1. Operational Excellence

* The operational excellence pillar focuses on how you can continuously improve your ability to run systems, create better procedures, and gain insights

#### Mental Model

* Think "Automation"
  * Human error is the cause of most issues. More automation == less human error

* Automation helps one continuously improve
  * Promotes a set of repeatable best practices

#### Concepts

* Focus on tasks with most manual work and biggets consequence for error
* Need a Process to track, analyze, and improve operational efforts

1. Infrastructure as Code - IaC

  * Declarative and automated way of provisioning infrastructure

  * Process of managing your infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files. 
    * IaC is the foundation that allows for the automation of your infrastructure
  
  * You create templates that describe the resources you want
    * The IaC platform then takes care of provisioning and configuring the resources
  
  * Service: [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/?id=docs_gateway)
    * Declare with JSON or YAML
    * Also a Cloud Dev Kit (CDK) - [CDK Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/?id=docs_gateway)
      * Allows authoring CF templates in native programming languages like Pyhton, JS, or Java
